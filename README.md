## üéô Introduction

The idea of the application is join commerces that do especific recycling for
people who need to deposit some items.\
The application consists in a commerce register on the web, adding your name, photo,

In the other side, people can use a mobile app to find the commerces by filtering
the location and items. After that they can contact them using email or whatsapp.

## üöÄ How to Start <a name="howToStart" />

First you need to [clone](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) or [fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the repository.

With the code in your machine, you'll open the terminal and will install all dependencies.

``` npm i ```

After that you'll need to create the database and insert initial data.

``` npm run knex:migrate ```\
``` npm run knex:seed ```

The last thing you'll need to do is start the server.

``` npm run dev ```

Now all is working. Congratulations!
